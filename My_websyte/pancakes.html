<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Krusteaz Baking Mix</li>
    <li>Lemon Zest</li>
    <li>Badia Vanilla Extract</li>
    <li>Optional Maine Blueberrys</li>
</ul>

<h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
    <li>First, lightly grease and preheat a griddle or get a skillet hot on the stovetop over medium-low heat.</li>
    <li>Then, use a whisk or fork to combine all of the ingredients in a medium bowl. It’s ok if there are some small lumps… For super fluffy pancakes, you want to be sure not to over-mix the batter. Once the batter starts to bubble a bit, it is ready to use.</li>
    <li>Now use a measuring scoop to pour the batter onto the hot griddle or skillet. Let the pancakes cook for 1-2 minutes undisturbed until the edges are dry and bubbles form on the tops.</li>
    <li>Use a spatula to check the bottom for doneness, and flip when golden. Cook for another minute or two until light brown. You can flip the pancake back and forth until just right.</li>
    <li>Serve with syrup</li>
</ol>
