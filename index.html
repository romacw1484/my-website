        <h1>Hello my name is William Romac...</h1>
        <p class="subtext">I am currently a Sophomore at Fordham University studying Computer Science. I started out my Fordham career by taking Computer Science II, learning the fundamentals of C++ and Visual Studio Code. In the spring of 2023, I took a comprehensive Data Structures course, were we used C++ to develop various graphing and computational functions, Stacks and Queues to help optimize storage, and different retrieval and sorting routines. Following this course, I pursued the Odin Projects Web Development course which allowed me to express my creativity in forms of HTML and CSS. Moving into this school year, I took Database Systems this fall where we learned SQL on MariaDB, developing different models and databases to resemble real world scenarios. I then began working with <i>Oracle Apex</i>, where I am currently working on a reservation system for Big Sqwaw Ski Mountain tying in my SQL knowledge. Leading up to where we are now, I am currently taking Computer Algorithms and Computer Organization and I am very excited!</p>
